Todo List:

1. Write JavaDocs for all the methods in the classes except the GUI classes
2. Go through all the warnings and change minor things that will not affect the code.
3. Make the typos write and ignore those which cannot be made right.
4. Run inspections and get everything right.
5. Understand the code.
